    "* Analyse the variables and their types (change if necessary)\n",
    "* How relevant is each variable to our task? (High, medium or low importance)\n",
    "* Understand the variables and their relations (categorical - count and bars, numerical - describe and hist, relations - seaborn, boxplot)\n",
    "* Analyse the distribution (skew, kurtosis, is it normal, what pattern does it follow ?)\n",
    "* Do we need some new variables?\n",
    "* Clean dataset (rename weirdly named variables, remove zero values, duplicates, fixing weird values (missing value? ) etc.)\n",
    "* Use functions to avoid code duplication and keep data in the same variable to maintain code blocks usage\n",
    "* Anything else?"
